// In graph theory, the terms “root,” “parent,” and “child” are typically used in the context of trees, which are a specific type of graph. Here’s a brief explanation:

// Root: In a tree, the root is the topmost node from which all other nodes descend. It is the starting point of the tree.
// Parent: A node that has one or more child nodes directly connected to it.
// Child: A node that is directly connected to another node (its parent) above it in the hierarchy.
// However, in general graphs (which can have cycles and multiple connections), these terms are not commonly used. Instead, we use terms like adjacent nodes or neighbors to describe the relationship between nodes.
